\title{Create adjacency matrix based on m/z (molecular weight) difference}
\usage{
structural(x, transformation, ppm = 5, directed = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{`matrix`, where columns are the samples and the rows are features
(metabolites), cell entries are intensity values. `x` contains the
column `"mz"` that has the m/z information (numerical values) for the
calculation of mass differences between features}

\item{transformation}{`data.frame`, containing the columns `"group"`,
and `"mass"` that will be used for detection of transformation of
(functional) groups}

\item{ppm}{`numeric`, mass accuracy of m/z features in parts per million (ppm)}

\item{directed}{`logical`, if `TRUE` absolute values of m/z differences will be
taken to query against `transformation`  (irrespective the sign of `mass`)
and an undirected adjacency matrix will be returned, if `FALSE` a directed
adjacency matrix will be returned with links reported that match the
transformations defined in `transformation` (respecting the sign of `mass`)}
}
\value{
`list` containing two matrices. The first entry stores the `numeric`
`matrix` with edges inferred from mass differences. The second entry
stores the `character` `matrix` with the type (corresponding to the
`"group"` column in `transformation`) is stored
}
\description{
The function `structural` infers an unweighted
adjacency matrix using differences in m/z values that are matched against a
`data.frame` of calculated theoretical differences of
loss/addition of functional groups. `structural` returns
the unweighted `numeric` `matrix` together with a `character` `matrix` with
the type of loss/addition as a list at the specific positions.
Changes to MetNet:
structural() has additional list entry of matrix containing mass values of respective matches
}
\details{
`structural` accesses the column `"mz"` of
`x` to infer structural topologies based on the functional groups
defined by `transformation`. To account for the mass accuracy of
the dataset `x`, the user can specify the accuracy of m/z features
in parts per million (ppm) by the `ppm` argument. The m/z values in the
`"mz"` column of `x`" will be converted to m/z ranges according to
the `ppm` argument (default `ppm = 5`).

    c("Trisaccharide (-H2O)", "C18H30O15", "486.1584702945"))
transformation <- data.frame(group = transformation[, 1],
                                formula = transformation[, 2],
                                mass = as.numeric(transformation[, 3]))
