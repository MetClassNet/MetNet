\title{Create a list of adjacency matrices from statistical methods}
\usage{
statistical(x, model, p = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{`matrix` that contains intensity values of
features/metabolites (rows) per sample (columns).}

\item{model}{`character` vector containing the methods that will be used
(`"lasso"`, `"randomForest"`, `"clr"`, `"aracne"`, `"pearson"`,
`"pearson_partial"`, `"pearson_semipartial"`, `"spearman"`,
`"spearman_partial"`, `"spearman_semipartial"`, `"bayes"`)}

\item{...}{parameters passed to the functions  `lasso`, `randomForest`,
`clr`, `aracne`, `correlation` and/or `bayes`}
}
\value{
`list` containing the respective adjacency matrices specified by
`model`
}
\description{
The function `statitical` infers adjacency matrix topologies from
statistical methods and returns matrices of these networks in a `list`. The
function includes functionality to calculate adjacency matrices based on
LASSO (L1 norm)-regression, random forests, context likelihood of
relatedness (CLR), the algorithm for the reconstruction of accurate
cellular networks (ARACNE), Pearson correlation (also partial and
semipartial), Spearman correlation (also partial and semipartial)
and score-based structure learning (Bayes). The function returns a
list of adjacency matrices that are defined by `model`.
Changes to MetNet:
additional attribute in funtion: p; default is FALSE (so works like MetNet), if p is TRUE and model is spearman/pearson
than the output will contain lists of pearson/spearman containing the corresponding correlation values (INCLUDING positive 
and negative values) and p-values
}
\details{
The function `statistical` includes functionality to calculate adjacency
matrices based on
LASSO (L1 norm)-regression, random forests, context likelihood of
relatedness (CLR), the algorithm for the reconstruction of accurate
cellular networks (ARACNE), Pearson correlation (also partial and
semipartial), Spearman correlation (also partial and semipartial)
and Constraint-based structure learning (Bayes).

`statistical` calls the function
`lasso`, `randomForest`, `clr`, `aracne`,
`correlation` (for `"pearson"`, `"pearson_partial"`, `"pearson_semipartial"`,
`"spearman"`, `"spearman_partial"`, `"spearman_semipartial"`) and/or `bayes`
as specified by `model`. It will create adjacency matrices using the
specified methods and will return a `list` containing the weighted
adjacency matrices.

Internally `x` will be z-scaled and the z-scaled object
will be used in `lasso`, `clr` and/or `aracne`.
