\title{Combine structural and statistical adjacency matrix}
\usage{
combine(
  structural,
  statistical,
  threshold = 1,
  model = "combined",
  weighted_statistical
)
}
\arguments{
\item{structural}{list containing `numeric` structural adjacency matrix in
the first entry and `character` structural adjanceny matrix in the second
entry}

\item{statistical}{matrix containing `numeric` statistical adjacency matrix}

\item{threshold}{numeric, threshold value to be applied to define a
connection as present}
}
\value{
`list`, in the first entry `matrix` of type `numeric`containing the
consensus adjacency matrix as described
above harbouring connections reported by the structual and
statistcal adjacency matrices. In the second entry a `matrix` of type
`character` the corresonding type/putative link at this position.
}
\description{
The function `combine` takes as
input the structural and statistical adjacency matrix, created in former
steps, adds them together and will report a connection between metabolites
in the returned when the sum exceeds the `threshold`.
\code{combine} returns this consensus matrix supported
by the structural and statistical adjacency matrices.

Changes to MetNet: New attributes added, if model = "combined" (default) the result will be the same 
as in MetNet, except the output list items were named to "combined" and "Character" 
if model = "pearson" or "spearman" than also the corresponding weighted statistical 
adjacency matrix is required as attribute (weighted_statistical = XY)
The output in this case will be a list containing 4 listitems, where combination relies on the
unweighted adjacency matrix of either Pearson or Spearman. 
Moreover corresponding Correlation and p-values will be displayes as listitems
}
\details{
The matrices will be added and a unweighted connection will
be reported when the value exceeds a certain value.

     formula = functional_groups[, 2],
     mass = as.numeric(functional_groups[, 3]))

    model = c("pearson", "spearman"),
